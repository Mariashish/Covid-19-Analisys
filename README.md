# Covid-19-Analisys
I have had the pleasure of having worked in the "Analisti Anonimi"group with colleagues of mine to complete the project in question: Analysis of Covid-19 data from 02/24/2020 to the current date. This was done in Python and the libraries that were used are: requests, json, matplotlib.pyplot and sqlite3.
